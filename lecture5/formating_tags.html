    <p style="font-style: unset;">As a <b>hunter</b>, the tiger is renowned for its focus and precision. It possesses exceptional vision and hearing, allowing it to keenly perceive even the slightest movements or sounds in its environment. These acute senses help the tiger identify potential prey, whether it be large ungulates like deer or smaller animals such as wild boars.

        When it comes to hunting, the tiger employs a patient and strategic approach. It uses its remarkable camouflage to blend seamlessly into its surroundings, patiently stalking its target from the cover of dense vegetation or tall grass. With its muscular body and powerful limbs, the tiger can move silently and with remarkable agility, ensuring that its prey remains unaware of its presence until it is too late.
